iat 355 - week 3 assignment

Purpose: this website showcases me! It explains my professinal background as a designer, includes some context of my previous work experience and also shows visualizations about beans.

Technologies used:  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Figma

Site can be navigated by clicking in the header to see the home page and the visualizations page (where my graph and cute bean drawing is located). Other than that, feel free to scroll! The yellow bean on the bottom of the visualizations page that I drew, you can click on that and enjoy what the bean says in the text box! :D

I should clarify, in the assets folder, the Global Beans Market xslx spreadsheet was from the source/link located on the graph in the Visualizations page. If you can find it, great! If not, I will include it right here: https://www.reportlinker.com/dataset/9d75662118cc66384c1f3d24f8fe78c6b013682b.

Also I wanted to choose this data because I like beans and I think the information and chart was interesting, and I wanted to see if I could recreate it through code! :D
