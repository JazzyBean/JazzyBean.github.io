## Purpose:
This website showcases my professinal background as a designer, and includes some context of my previous work experience and visualizations about beans.

## Technologies used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Figma (where I developed the images seen on my website)

## This site can be navigated by:
Clicking in the header to see the home page and the visualizations page and vertical scrolling. For the bean on the bottom of the visualizations page, you can click on it and enjoy what the bean says in the text box!

I should clarify, in the assets folder, the Global Beans Market... xslx spreadsheet was from the source/link located on the graph in the Visualizations page. 

If you can find it, great! If not, I will include it right here: https://www.reportlinker.com/dataset/9d75662118cc66384c1f3d24f8fe78c6b013682b. 

For the sake of the graph, I only included just the first 10 countries. Furthermore, I wanted to choose this specific data because I was curious about the global bean market and consumption and which specific countries would be involved. I also found the chart interesting, and I wanted to see if I could recreate the entire thing using code, showing my understanding of HTMLL, CSS and JavaScript.
